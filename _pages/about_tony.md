I have been at Franklin and Marshall College for over 15 years.  During that time I have taught courses in the Computer Science and Psychology departments
in addition to working with faculty and students to facilitate research. I have an M.S. in Computer Science as well as an M.A. in Psychology.  
My interests include language learning (both machine and human) and human computer interaction.
