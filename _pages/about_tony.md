I have been at Franklin and Marshall College for over 15 years.  During that 
time I have taught courses in the Computer Science and Psychology departments
in addition to working with faculty and students to facilitate research. I have 
an M.S. in Computer Science as well as an M.A. in Psychology. My interests 
include language learning (both machine and human) and human computer interaction.
