## Overview

Research Computing Services (RCS) provides computational support to research and 
teaching when those needs excede the capabailities of a standard personal 
computer. Our goal is to make the access and use of specialized compute 
and data storage resources easier for faculty and students 
at Franklin & Marshall College as well as to facilitate 
collaboration across institutions.

You may reach us by opening a [support request](https://request.fandm.edu/)
or via e-mail: dorc@fandm.edu

We provide assistance in the following areas:

### Computing
  - High Performance Computing (HPC) cluster
  - GPU-based computation systems
  - High-memory compute systems
  - External compute resources (e.g. Open Science Grid)

### Software
  - Research-related software installation and maintenance
  - installation, troubleshooting, optimization, and training on how to effectively utilize the software for data analysis, simulations, and other computational tasks; essentially, it's technical support tailored specifically to the complex software used in scientific research. 

  - General purpose software (e.g., MATLAB, Jupyter Notebooks, etc.)

### Data
  - Storage and backup
  - Shared data for research groups
  - Data transfer/sharing with collaborators using Globus

### Education and outreach
  - Training for different resources (compute cluster, Globus, etc.)
  - Computational workflow review/optimization

### Grant assitance
  - Guidance for equipment/software purchasing
  - Data management

## Class/teaching support

We also provide some support/access to computational resources to 
classes that wish to use:

- ArcGIS
- MATLAB
- Jupyter Notebooks
- RStudio Pro
- Webwork
