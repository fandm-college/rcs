# Overview

Research Computing Services (RCS) provides computational support to research and 
teaching when those needs excede the capabailities of a standard personal 
computer. Our goal is to make the access and use of specialized compute 
and data storage resources easier for faculty and students 
at Franklin & Marshall College as well as to facilitate 
collaboration across institutions.
